# Movie-Dataset-Analysis
This project uses the TMDb Movie Dataset that contains more than 10,000 records of movies with details on title, budget, revenue, cast, directors, popularities, etc. The dataset allows to explore two following questions:
- The general trends are associated with movies over time? 
- What are the common traits among the profitable films regarding genre, actors, directors, production firms, budget and runtime.
